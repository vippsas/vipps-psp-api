    - [ ] The Vipps branding must be according to the [Vipps design guidelines](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-design-guidelines)

## Live flow

1. The PSP completes all checklist items.
2. The PSP [contacts Vipps](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/vipps-developers/contact) with test IDs (`pspTransactionId`, `merchantOrderId`) in the [Vipps test environment](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/vipps-developers/test-environment), showing that all checklist items have been fulfilled.
    - A complete order including `Reserve`, `Capture` and `Refund`, that has been updated with [`POST:/v3/psppayments/updatestatus`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/api/psp#tag/Vipps-PSP-API/operation/updatestatusUsingPOST).
    - A complete order including `Cancel`, that has been updated with [`POST:/v3/psppayments/updatestatus`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/api/psp#tag/Vipps-PSP-API/operation/updatestatusUsingPOST).
    - One ID for each of the [error codes](vipps-psp-api.md#errors).
        - Some codes like 85 aren't applicable for all systems, please provide short description for why each code does not apply.
3. The PSP [contacts Vipps](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/vipps-developers/contact) to verify the integration in the production environment:
    - At least one IDs for orders with each of the following statuses: `Capture`, `Refund`, `Cancel`.
    - At least 3 IDs for orders with different [error codes](vipps-psp-api.md#errors).
4. The PSP goes live ðŸŽ‰
