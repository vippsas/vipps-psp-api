# Vipps PSP API version 2

[Vipps på Nett](https://www.vipps.no/bedrift/vipps-pa-nett)
(eCommerce) via PSP offers functionality for payments on
websites and apps (P2M). Vipps på Nett offers merchants functionality to
provide a solution where the end user only enters her Norwegian mobile number
to retrieve a payment request in the Vipps app.

In the Vipps app the end user selects a payment source to complete the payment
request. Vipps initiates the payment transaction on the selected source and
provide feedback to the PSP of the payment card selected.

The PSP processes the payment transaction and provides feedback to merchant
and Vipps of the payment transaction success or failure.

### PSP implementation checklist

See the [Vipps PSP API Checklist](vipps-psp-api-checklist.md) for details.

### Initiate payment

A payment request is initiated by the PSP to the Vipps API after end user has
request to pay with Vipps. Vipps creates the payment and returns a link to
the Vipps landing page where end user can confirm the mobile number.
Once user has confirmed number the payment can be considered initiated.

### Payment confirmation

After payment initiation, Vipps sends push notification or redirects user to
the Vipps app. End user verifies the Vipps profile by logging in to the Vipps
app. In the Vipps app the end user can select payment source and confirm the amount.

### MakePayment

Once the end user has confirmed the payment, Vipps shares the encrypted card
details with the PSP to the makePaymentUrl. PSP tries to process the payment
through the acquirer and responds to the makePayment-call with the payment
request status. End user receives confirmation in Vipps app. Vipps redirects
the end user to the redirectUrl provided during payment initiation.

## Example request

```json
Authorization: makePaymentToken
{
  "pspTransactionId": "7686f7788898767977",
  "merchantSerialNumber": "123456",
  "cardData": "f0a29801b4#d4ff30e221fa2980ff30e2",
  "confirmed": "YES/TIMEOUT/CANCEL"
}
```

## Example response

```json
{
  "errorMessage": {
    "errorId": 82,
    "errorText": "Refused by Issuer"
  },
  "paymentInfo": {
    "pspTransactionId": "7686f7788898767977",
    "status": "FAIL"
  }
}
```

## Idempotency

All API requests in Vipps eCommerce can be retried without any side effects
by providing idempotent key in a header of  the request. For example, in
case the request fails because of network error it can safely be retried
with the same idempotent key. Idempotent key is generated by merchant.

```
Request-Id: slvnwdcweofjwefweklfwelf
```

# Authentication

Every API call is authenticated and authorized based on the application
Authorization token (JWT) and APIM subscription key
(`Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key`). Following headers are required to be there in every API request
to successfully authenticate every API call.

| Header Name | Header Value | Description |
| :-------------------------- | :--------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| Authorization | Bearer 'jwt_access_token'' | type: Authorization token. Value: Access token is obtained from accessToken/get |
| Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key | Base 64 encoded string | Subscription key for the product.<br>Can be found in Vipps developer portal |
